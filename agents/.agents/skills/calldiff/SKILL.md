name: calldiff
description: Diff call stacks across git commits — like git diff, but for who-calls-whom. Shows which callees appeared, disappeared, or moved under an entrypoint across 23 languages (diff, tree, and reach). Use for agentic code review when call flow changed and line diffs bury the shape of the change.

# calldiff diff

Diff call stacks between two git trees

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `from` | `string` | no | Before ref (default: HEAD) |
| `to` | `string` | no | After ref (default: working tree) |
| `paths` | `array` | no | Limit to these path prefixes |

## Options

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--entry` | `unknown` |  | Entrypoint symbol(s): functionName or ClassName.method |
| `--file` | `unknown` |  | Entrypoint file(s): indexed source path; expands to that file's exports |
| `--maxDepth` | `number` | `12` | Max call-tree depth |
| `--locs` | `boolean` | `false` | Show call-site source locations (file:line) |
| `--from` | `string` |  | Left / "before" tree |
| `--to` | `string` |  | Right / "after" tree |

## Examples

```sh
# HEAD vs working tree
calldiff diff

# One ref vs working tree
calldiff diff main

# Two commits / branches
calldiff diff abc123 def456

# Force entrypoints
calldiff diff main feature --entry createAgentSession

# File expands to that file's exports
calldiff diff main feature --file src/routes.ts
```

> Semantics match git diff: no refs → HEAD vs worktree; one ref → that vs worktree; two refs → compare those trees.

# calldiff reach

Find all call paths from an entrypoint to a target symbol

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ref` | `string` | no | Git ref (default: working tree) |
| `paths` | `array` | no | Limit to these path prefixes |

## Options

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--entry` | `unknown` |  | Entrypoint symbol(s): functionName or ClassName.method |
| `--file` | `unknown` |  | Entrypoint file(s): indexed source path; expands to that file's exports |
| `--to` | `string` |  | Target symbol to reach (functionName or ClassName.method) |
| `--maxDepth` | `number` | `12` | Max call-tree depth |
| `--locs` | `boolean` | `false` | Show call-site source locations (file:line) |

## Examples

```sh
# Paths in the working tree
calldiff reach --entry runCheckout --to sendEmail

# Paths at a commit, limited to a directory
calldiff reach HEAD examples/checkout --entry runCheckout --to sendEmail

# Paths from every export in a file
calldiff reach --file packages/api/src/flow.ts --to notify
```

# calldiff tree

View a call tree (no diff) for one or more entrypoints

## Arguments

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ref` | `string` | no | Git ref (default: working tree) |
| `paths` | `array` | no | Limit to these path prefixes |

## Options

| Flag | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--entry` | `unknown` |  | Entrypoint symbol(s): functionName or ClassName.method |
| `--file` | `unknown` |  | Entrypoint file(s): indexed source path; expands to that file's exports |
| `--maxDepth` | `number` | `12` | Max call-tree depth |
| `--locs` | `boolean` | `false` | Show call-site source locations (file:line) |

## Examples

```sh
# Tree from working tree
calldiff tree --entry createAgentSession

# Tree from a commit
calldiff tree HEAD --entry PiService.createAgentSession

# Every export in a file
calldiff tree --file packages/api/src/routes.ts
```
