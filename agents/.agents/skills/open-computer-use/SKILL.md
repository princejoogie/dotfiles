description: Platform-neutral guidance for using Open Computer Use, the open-source Computer Use MCP server and CLI for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Use when an agent needs to install, verify, troubleshoot, configure, or operate Open Computer Use through its native CLI, stdio MCP server, or direct Computer Use tool calls.

# Open Computer Use

## Overview

Open Computer Use exposes Computer Use as a local CLI and stdio MCP server, usable by any agent runtime.

It supports the same core tool surface across macOS, Linux, and Windows:
`list_apps`, `get_app_state`, `click`, `perform_secondary_action`, `scroll`,
`drag`, `type_text`, `press_key`, and `set_value`.

## Core Workflow

1. Check the CLI is installed with `open-computer-use -h`. If installation or setup is missing, read [references/installation.md](references/installation.md).
2. On macOS, run `open-computer-use doctor` before the first real GUI task. If permissions are missing, ask the user to approve Accessibility and Screen Recording in the onboarding UI.
3. Inspect available apps before acting: `open-computer-use call list_apps`.
4. Capture current UI state with `open-computer-use call get_app_state --args '{"app":"TextEdit"}'`.
5. Prefer element-targeted actions using `element_index` from the latest `get_app_state` result.
6. For multi-step CLI work, use `open-computer-use call --calls '<json-array>'` so one process can reuse the latest element index mapping.
7. For agent runtimes that support local MCP servers, configure `open-computer-use mcp` and call the exposed Computer Use tools directly. Read [references/usage.md](references/usage.md).
8. If communication, permission, or desktop-session access fails, read [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md).

## Operating Rules

- Treat the target desktop as the user's real session. Do not inspect password managers, unrelated private content, or sensitive apps unless the user explicitly asked for that task.
- Ask before sending, deleting, purchasing, approving, uploading, or making other externally visible changes.
- Always use the installed `open-computer-use` CLI or an explicit MCP config; do not assume host-specific plugin helpers exist.
- Always run `get_app_state` before using `element_index`; do not guess indexes across sessions or after large UI changes.
- Prefer semantic actions and `set_value` for editable controls. Use coordinate `click`, `scroll`, and `drag` only when the element tree does not expose a safer target.
- On macOS, do not enable `OPEN_COMPUTER_USE_ALLOW_GLOBAL_POINTER_FALLBACKS=1` unless the user explicitly wants diagnostic behavior that may move the real pointer.
- On Windows and Linux, confirm the command is running inside the logged-in desktop session before assuming GUI automation is available.

## Common CLI Actions

```sh
open-computer-use -h
open-computer-use doctor
open-computer-use call list_apps
open-computer-use call get_app_state --args '{"app":"TextEdit"}'
open-computer-use call click --args '{"app":"TextEdit","element_index":0}'
open-computer-use call type_text --args '{"app":"TextEdit","text":"Hello from Open Computer Use"}'
```

For a short sequence that reuses state in one process:

```sh
open-computer-use call --calls '[
  {"tool":"get_app_state","args":{"app":"TextEdit"}},
  {"tool":"press_key","args":{"app":"TextEdit","key":"Return"}}
]'
```

## MCP Usage

For runtimes that can launch local MCP servers over stdio, use:

```toml
[mcp_servers.open_computer_use]
command = "open-computer-use"
args = ["mcp"]
```
