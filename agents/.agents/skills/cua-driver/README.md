# Cua Driver agent skill

This cross-agent skill teaches an AI agent to operate native applications on
macOS, Windows, and Linux with the
[`cua-driver`](https://github.com/trycua/cua/tree/main/libs/cua-driver/rust)
CLI or MCP server.

It covers the canonical snapshot-action-verify loop, exact window addressing,
accessibility and pixel actions, background/foreground delivery, typed browser
automation, session recording, and platform-specific limitations. The skill
defaults to background delivery and requires structured refusal or observed
failure before a caller escalates to foreground input.

## Install Cua Driver

macOS or Linux:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://cua.ai/driver/install.sh)"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://cua.ai/driver/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then verify the current host:

```bash
cua-driver doctor
```

On macOS, the installed `CuaDriver.app` needs Accessibility and Screen
Recording permission. On Windows, the daemon must run in an interactive user
desktop rather than Session 0. On Linux, the daemon must share the graphical
session and AT-SPI session bus.

## Install the skill

From ClawHub:

```bash
clawhub install @cua/driver
```

Or let the installed driver add the version-matched skill to detected agent
directories:

```bash
cua-driver skills install
```

The direct installer keeps only the current host's platform guide by default.
Use `--all-platforms` when the agent assists users across operating systems.
`cua-driver skills update` refreshes the pack to match a later driver release.

## Reading order

- `SKILL.md`: shared contract, tool selection, session identity,
  snapshot-action-verify loop, action ladder, and failure handling.
- `MACOS.md`, `WINDOWS.md`, or `LINUX.md`: host-specific launch, capture,
  accessibility, input delivery, permissions, and refusal boundaries.
- `BROWSER.md`: exact browser-window binding, explicit profile preparation,
  page refs, trust-classified click/type/navigation, and native fallbacks.
- `RECORDING.md`: trajectory evidence, MP4 capture, and replay.
- `EMBEDDING.md`: embedding the driver into another host application.

The agent should load `SKILL.md`, the current platform guide, and only the
cross-cutting guide needed for the task.

## Browser model

Browser work starts from the same native `(pid, window_id)` selection as every
other app. `get_browser_state` binds that exact window to a session-scoped
target and tab, then returns short-lived page refs for `browser_click`,
`browser_type`, and `browser_navigate`.

Setup is never a hidden read side effect. `browser_prepare` requires explicit
approval before launching a driver-managed profile or attaching to an existing
authenticated profile. Trusted pointer input and synthetic DOM clicks are
reported as different routes; the driver refuses instead of silently changing
trust class or foregrounding a standalone browser.

See `BROWSER.md` for the supported surface and exact recovery rules.

## Recording

Session recording captures before/after state, screenshots, action metadata,
and optional MP4 video. macOS uses ScreenCaptureKit. Windows uses ffmpeg with
`gdigrab`. Linux uses compositor-specific capture or ffmpeg with `x11grab`.
Availability is reported honestly when a host dependency or portal grant is
missing. See `RECORDING.md`.

## Updates and source builds

The skill is versioned with Cua Driver releases. For bleeding-edge validation
against `main`:

```bash
cua-driver skills install --from main
```

From a local checkout, `libs/cua-driver/scripts/install-local.sh` installs the
source-built macOS driver as `cua-driver-local` and `CuaDriverLocal.app`, without
replacing the release installation. Keep standalone and embedded identity rules from
`MACOS.md` and `EMBEDDING.md`; launching a raw binary is not a substitute for
the stable app identity that owns macOS TCC grants.
