# Embedding cua-driver in your application without introducing new permissions

This guide is for teams shipping a macOS app (an "agent harness") that wants
cua-driver's background computer-use and agent-cursor overlay **inside their
own app**, without shipping a second app bundle and without their users ever
seeing a second macOS permission prompt. Your app requests Accessibility and
Screen Recording once; the embedded driver inherits those grants.

A working daemon-host reference lives in the cua repo at
`libs/cua-driver/rust/examples/embedded-host-macos/`
(https://github.com/trycua/cua). This doc ships standalone in the skill
pack, so the path is given rather than a relative link.

## How macOS attributes these permissions (what you must know)

macOS TCC (the privacy system behind System Settings → Privacy & Security)
does not attribute Accessibility or Screen Recording to an executable path.
It attributes them to the **responsible process**: the app at the top of the
process's launch chain, as tracked by the kernel/LaunchServices. When your
signed app spawns a child with `posix_spawn`, `NSTask`/`Process`, or plain
`fork`/`exec`, that child stays inside _your_ responsibility chain — TCC
checks made by the child are answered with **your app's** grants, and any
prompt it triggered would name **your app**. This is exactly the behavior
embedding relies on: grant once to the host, and every well-behaved child
inherits. (Apple documents the attribution chain; you can watch it live with
`log stream --debug --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.TCC" AND eventMessage BEGINSWITH "AttributionChain"'`.)

Two things break the chain, and both are things the embedded driver must
_not_ do (and, in embedded mode, does not do). First, launching via
LaunchServices (`open -a …`, `NSWorkspace.open`) makes the launched app its
own responsible process. Second, a process can explicitly _disclaim_
responsibility for a child (`responsibility_spawnattrs_setdisclaim`), making
the child its own responsible process — standalone cua-driver does this on
purpose so its permissions attach to a stable `com.trycua.driver` identity
instead of whatever terminal launched it. Embedded mode turns that off.

Note this is TCC **responsibility** inheritance — it is unrelated to App
Sandbox inheritance (`com.apple.security.inherit`). This guide assumes a
non-sandboxed host, which is typical for agent harnesses; a sandboxed host
spawning a non-sandboxed helper raises separate App Sandbox questions that
embedded mode does not address.

## Preferred application SDK: same-process runtime

Python and TypeScript applications should normally import the packaged SDK and
create `CuaDriver` directly. This path does not start an executable or open a
socket, and TCC checks execute as the importing application:

```ts
import { CuaDriver } from '@trycua/cua-driver';

const driver = CuaDriver.create(undefined);
try {
  const metadata = await driver.metadata();
  // Invoke typed driver operations here.
} finally {
  await driver.shutdown();
  driver.uniffiDestroy();
}
```

The direct runtime never presents macOS permission UI. Even
`check_permissions({prompt: true})` is forced into a read-only check and
reports the host as the responsible permission owner. After the host changes
Accessibility or Screen Recording grants, fully relaunch the host before
creating a replacement runtime.

The AppKit agent-cursor overlay is not available in an arbitrary direct
runtime. Until a host installs a certified main-thread UI adapter, overlay
methods return structured `facility_unavailable` results. Use the private
worker or daemon-backed host when the visible overlay is required.

Use the daemon-backed host below only when the application must also provide a
stable MCP endpoint to an external agent, coordinate external clients, or keep
the automation runtime isolated from the application process.

## Launching the daemon-backed host

```sh
# env var form — set by the host on the child process
CUA_DRIVER_EMBEDDED=1 CUA_DRIVER_HOST_BUNDLE_ID=com.yourco.yourapp \
  cua-driver serve --socket /tmp/yourapp-cua.sock

# after the daemon socket is ready, start the stdio MCP proxy
CUA_DRIVER_EMBEDDED=1 cua-driver mcp --socket /tmp/yourapp-cua.sock
```

Requirements on the host side:

- **Spawn `cua-driver serve --embedded` directly** as a child process
  (`Process`/`NSTask`, `posix_spawn`, `exec` from your own code). Do
  **not** launch the daemon via `open(1)` or `NSWorkspace` — that hands it
  to LaunchServices and breaks inheritance.
- Give the daemon a private socket and wait until it is accepting connections.
- Spawn `cua-driver mcp --embedded --socket <path>` and speak MCP over that
  proxy's stdin/stdout (line-delimited JSON-RPC). The proxy never executes
  tools; the host-owned daemon does.
- Request Accessibility and Screen Recording **from your app** before (or
  after — the driver just reports "not granted" until then) starting the
  driver, using `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions([kAXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt: true])`
  and `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess()`.

Only the exact value `CUA_DRIVER_EMBEDDED=1` enables embedded mode; anything
else is ignored (fail-safe). `--host-bundle-id` is an advisory label echoed
in `check_permissions` output and logs — it is **not** a trust signal; trust
comes from the OS responsibility chain, so there is nothing to spoof by
setting it.

## Choosing the agent permission mode

Embedded hosts own their user-facing permission experience, but they must
select Cua Driver's immutable runtime mode at trusted launch. The choices are:

- `standard`: promptless routine automation, with explicit host authorization
  only for residual boundaries such as an existing logged-in Chromium profile.
- `bounded`: unattended work inside an approved tool and resource manifest.
- `unrestricted`: no Cua runtime approvals; use only when the host accepts the
  consequences of prompt injection and unintended actions.

Direct SDK hosts may install `DriverAuthorizationHost` for residual
standard-mode decisions and `DriverActivityObserver` for content-free action
events. Cua Driver does not render its own authorization modal or banner.

For unrestricted embedding, use the explicit two-part environment contract:

```sh
CUA_DRIVER_EMBEDDED=1 \
CUA_DRIVER_PERMISSION_MODE=unrestricted \
CUA_DRIVER_DANGEROUSLY_BYPASS_APPROVALS=1 \
  cua-driver serve --embedded --socket /tmp/yourapp-cua.sock
```

Both values are required and contradictory values fail before the daemon
binds. They belong in trusted launcher configuration; never expose either as
an agent-settable MCP or raw-socket argument. Interactive operators can use
the equivalent single CLI shortcut, `--dangerously-bypass-approvals`, which
selects unrestricted mode and records the acknowledgement. The older
`autonomous` mode name remains accepted as an alias for `bounded` during
migration.

### Node and Electron daemon hosts

Use the embedded host in `@trycua/cua-driver` instead of implementing process
and socket management in every host. It starts a private daemon directly, waits
until its socket accepts connections, returns SDK and MCP connection details,
and owns restart and cleanup:

```ts
import { CuaDriver, EmbeddedCuaDriverHost } from '@trycua/cua-driver';

const embedded = new EmbeddedCuaDriverHost(
  '/path/inside/YourApp.app/Contents/Resources/cua-driver',
  'com.example.your-app'
);
const connection = await embedded.start();
const driver = CuaDriver.connect(connection.socketPath);
// Application calls use driver; an agent runtime uses connection.mcp.
driver.uniffiDestroy();
await embedded.stop();
embedded.uniffiDestroy();
```

The package does not install or bundle cua-driver. Ship a compatible executable
outside Electron's ASAR archive, preserve its executable bit, and sign the
nested executable before signing and notarizing the enclosing macOS app.
Electron main processes can use the package's `/electron` entry point for
low-level Accessibility and Screen Recording requests after `app.whenReady()`;
the calls run as the importing host, not the child driver. The host still owns
permission UI, status, and restart policy. These functions use the same
generated Rust SDK; there is no second native FFI dependency. Some macOS
releases refuse to raise a Screen Recording prompt; in that case, open the
Screen Recording settings pane with
`openMacOSScreenRecordingSettings()`, ask the user to add the host app, and
start the driver only after both checks return true.

Destroy the SDK client and call `await embedded.stop()` from every orderly
shutdown path. If grants change, destroy the SDK client, call
`embedded.restart()`, and reconnect. Electron hosts must defer their first
`before-quit` event until cleanup completes because asynchronous cleanup cannot
run after the host process exits. Normal OpenClaw
gateway and Hermes YAML configurations remain standalone integrations; use the
package only when their signed Node or Electron app process directly owns the
daemon child.

### Lifecycle rules

- Concurrent `start()` calls coalesce into one daemon generation.
- Treat `connection` as generation-scoped. After `restart()`, destroy old SDK
  clients and MCP proxies and reconnect from the newly returned descriptor.
- Stop new work, end sessions, close proxies/clients, then await `stop()`.
  `stop()` is idempotent and cancels an in-progress start.
- Observe unexpected termination with `waitForExit(generation)` in Node or
  `wait_for_exit(generation)` in Python. Never blindly replay an action whose
  completion is unknown.
- The Rust owner holds a parent-liveness pipe, so host death closes the daemon;
  orderly shutdown should still await `stop()`.
- Capture modality belongs to each observation or action target, not to the
  lifecycle session. One embedded daemon can concurrently serve exact window
  and desktop calls without changing session state.
- Permission changes require destroying clients, restarting the daemon, and
  reconnecting. A connection from the old generation is never reusable.

## What embedded mode changes (and what it doesn't)

|                                               | Standalone                    | Embedded (`CUA_DRIVER_EMBEDDED=1`)     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Responsibility disclaim re-exec               | ON (owns its TCC identity)    | OFF (stays in the host's chain)        |
| Tool execution process                        | `serve` daemon                | host-spawned `serve --embedded` daemon |
| Daemon auto-relaunch via `open -a CuaDriver`  | Yes, when installed           | Never (would leave the host's chain)   |
| TCC identity                                  | `com.trycua.driver`           | the host app                           |
| Permission prompts / startup gate             | May prompt once               | **Never prompts**                      |
| Settings → Privacy & Security entries         | CuaDriver                     | your app only                          |
| `check_permissions` `source.attribution`      | `driver-daemon` (or `caller`) | `host`                                 |
| Overlay, background input, capture, all tools | full                          | full — identical                       |

Everything else — the agent-cursor overlay, background (no-focus-steal)
clicking and typing, AX tree reads, per-window screenshots — is unchanged.
When embedded mode is off, nothing in this feature is active: standalone
behavior is byte-for-byte what it was.

## The responsibility-chain requirement, exactly

The host must be the responsible process for the driver. That holds
automatically when you spawn the `serve` daemon directly and embedded mode
is on. If the daemon were allowed to disclaim (standalone behavior), macOS
would treat it as its own responsible process: your user would get a _second_ prompt
attributed to the driver binary, a second Settings entry, and capture/AX
would fail until that second grant — the exact experience embedding exists
to eliminate. Embedded mode short-circuits the disclaim re-exec
(`responsibility.rs`) and the `open -a CuaDriver` daemon relaunch. MCP is
always a proxy, so the embedded daemon remains the single process that checks
TCC and executes tools.

### App + gateway architectures

`--embedded` does not transfer a GUI app's permissions to the driver; it
only keeps the driver inside its **spawner's** TCC responsibility chain. If
your product has a GUI app that owns the macOS grants and a separate
gateway, daemon, or Node process that spawns MCP servers, registering
`cua-driver serve --embedded` with the gateway makes the daemon inherit the
gateway's identity, not the app's. Spawn the daemon from the GUI app itself;
gateways may connect an MCP proxy to the app-owned private socket.

```text
Wrong (inherits the gateway's identity):        Right:

gateway / node daemon                           YourApp.app
  └─ cua-driver serve --embedded                  ├─ cua-driver serve --embedded
                                                  └─ cua-driver mcp --embedded
                                                     --socket <private-path>
```

Note `check_permissions` cannot detect this: `source.attribution` reports
`host` whenever `CUA_DRIVER_EMBEDDED=1` is set, even if a gateway spawned
the driver. The symptoms are grant booleans that track the _gateway's_ TCC
state and prompts/Settings entries naming the gateway process; see
Troubleshooting below.

## Reading `check_permissions` from the host

Call the `check_permissions` tool over MCP. In embedded mode it never raises
a dialog (the `prompt` argument is ignored) and returns:

```json
{
  "accessibility": true,
  "screen_recording": true,
  "screen_recording_capturable": null,
  "direct_capture_status": "not_checked",
  "source": {
    "attribution": "host",
    "host_bundle_id": "com.yourco.yourapp",
    "embedded": true,
    "pid": 12345,
    "responsible_ppid": 12300,
    "executable": "/path/to/cua-driver",
    "disclaim_env": false,
    "note": "Embedded mode: these booleans reflect the HOST app's TCC grant…"
  }
}
```

- `accessibility` / `screen_recording` — the live TCC state _of your app's
  grant_, answered from inside the driver process (which shares your
  identity). If both are true, it is safe to drive the desktop.
- `screen_recording_capturable` / `direct_capture_status` — embedded
  `check_permissions` is read-only and never runs Tahoe's prompt-capable
  ScreenCaptureKit probe, so these are `null` / `not_checked`. The host owns
  the permission UX and should verify pixels with an explicit screenshot or
  capture operation after explaining the prompt.
- `source.attribution` values:
  - `host` — embedded mode; booleans reflect the host's grant. What you
    should always see when embedding.
  - `driver-daemon` — standalone daemon owning `com.trycua.driver`. If you
    see this while embedding, embedded mode is not actually set.
  - `caller` — a non-embedded, non-bundle launch (e.g. someone ran the
    binary from a terminal); booleans reflect the terminal's grants.

If a permission is missing, the correct reaction is: **the host requests
it** (the two API calls above), then re-calls `check_permissions`. The
driver never owns the host's OS permission experience.

Heads-up on grant timing: macOS caches TCC answers per process. If your app
requests/receives the grants _after_ the driver child is already running,
restart the driver child so it re-queries with a fresh cache.

## Minimal host example (copy-paste)

The file below is the complete reference host — mirrored verbatim from
`libs/cua-driver/rust/examples/embedded-host-macos/ExampleAgentHarness.swift`
in the cua repo (which also has a build-and-run `demo.sh` covering the
TCC-reset flow).
It requests the two grants as the host, spawns an embedded daemon plus an MCP
proxy, and runs the whole demo sequence: attribution check, background screenshot,
background AX read, agent-cursor glide.

Build it as a signed app bundle (a stable signing identity is what keys
the TCC grant rows to your app):

```sh
mkdir -p ExampleAgentHarness.app/Contents/MacOS
swiftc -O ExampleAgentHarness.swift \

tail -f /tmp/cua-embedded-demo.log
```

## Troubleshooting

**"I still get a second permission prompt / a second Settings entry."**
Embedded mode is not in effect for the process doing the TCC check. Causes,
in order of likelihood: (a) `CUA_DRIVER_EMBEDDED` is not exactly `1`, or was
set on your app but not passed into the daemon child's environment; (b) the daemon
was launched via `open(1)` / `NSWorkspace` instead of spawned directly, so
it is its own responsible process; (c) the MCP proxy connected to an old standalone `CuaDriver.app` daemon — check
`check_permissions` → `source.attribution` (must be `host`) and verify
that the proxy uses the host's private socket. To see exactly which identity macOS is charging,
run: `log stream --debug --predicate 'subsystem == "com.apple.TCC" AND
eventMessage BEGINSWITH "AttributionChain"'` and trigger the action again.

**"Screenshots come back black even though `screen_recording: true`."**
The read-only permission check cannot verify direct ScreenCaptureKit access
without risking a system dialog. Exercise an explicit screenshot only after
the host has explained the OS permission. If that fails, the grant may not
belong to the driver's current responsible identity, may have been reset, or
the driver may have escaped the host's chain (see the previous item). Restart
the driver child after any grant change — TCC answers are cached per process.

**"The AX tree comes back empty / clicks do nothing."**
`AXIsProcessTrusted()` is false for the effective identity. The host hasn't
been granted Accessibility, or was granted it _after_ the driver child
started (per-process cache again — restart the child), or the app was
re-signed/moved so the existing grant row no longer matches it (remove and
re-add it in System Settings, or `tccutil reset Accessibility <your-bundle-id>`
and re-grant).

**"It worked, then stopped after I updated/re-signed my app."**
TCC grant rows are keyed to the app's code-signing identity. A signature
change can orphan the old row. Reset and re-grant:
`tccutil reset Accessibility com.yourco.yourapp && tccutil reset ScreenCapture com.yourco.yourapp`.

## Platform notes (Windows / Linux)

Embedding also works on Windows and Linux (X11) with **no per-app permission
ceremony**. The host still spawns a daemon in the intended interactive session
or desktop, then points MCP and CLI adapters at its private socket. The
one-grant inheritance story in this guide is macOS-specific because macOS is
the platform where Accessibility and Screen Recording grants follow the
responsibility chain.

Two known exceptions:

- **Windows, elevated / UWP targets**: pixel or SendInput delivery into a
  higher-integrity target requires an interactively launched High-IL daemon
  (the installed autostart task uses `RunLevel=Highest`). The
  `cua-driver-uia` pipe is a reserved, default-off daemon-internal boundary;
  embedding hosts and other public clients must not launch or connect to it.
- **Linux Wayland** (compositor-specific): capture goes through XDG desktop
  portals, which prompt per-session at capture time and cannot be
  pre-granted by the host. X11 has no portal gate.
