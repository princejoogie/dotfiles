# cua-driver: Windows

Orchestrates Windows app automation via the `cua-driver` binary (`cua-driver.exe`). Whenever a user
asks to drive a native Windows app, follow the loop in this doc
rather than calling tools ad-hoc: the snapshot-before-action
invariant is not optional and silently breaks if you skip it.

`SKILL.md` in this directory describes the cross-platform core;
this file is the Windows-specific extension. Read both:
the snapshot invariant, MCP-vs-CLI choice, agent cursor overlay, and
recording flow are identical. The launch, click, and accessibility-
tree mechanics in this file replace the macOS ones.

## Background window delivery

**Background window actions must preserve the user's frontmost app.**
Foreground and desktop actions follow the authorization boundary in
[RUNTIME.md](RUNTIME.md#foreground-boundary). Users pay for the right
to keep typing in their editor while an agent drives another app in
the background. Violate this rule and every other nice property the
driver gives you (no cursor warp, no taskbar flash, no window
restore-and-raise) stops mattering: you just shipped a `SendInput`
wrapper with extra steps.

### How the contract is enforced per call: the `delivery_mode` field

Every Windows input tool (`click`, `double_click`, `right_click`,
`drag`, `scroll`, `press_key`, `hotkey`, `type_text`) accepts an
optional `delivery_mode` field: this mirrors the macOS `delivery_mode`
surface (same name, same two values). The default is `"background"`:
strict no-foreground:

| `delivery_mode`          | Behavior on Windows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"background"` (DEFAULT) | Never fronts and **never raises/restacks** the target: macOS-aligned (mirrors CGEvent-to-pid). **Pixel clicks**: a UIA hit-test at the point first (accessibility-channel Invoke, works on UWP / WinUI3 / Win11 packaged apps, no flash); if that misses, coordinate-injected pen/touch, **but only when the target is the _visible_ window at that point**; PostMessage for plain Win32. It returns a structured `background_unavailable` error (rather than raising or fronting) when the target is **occluded** at the point, or the event kind is known-dropped (Chromium DOM mouse + key-combos, GTK buttons, VCL/LibreOffice accelerators, terminal / WPF text with no `element_token`). **No foreground swap and no z-order raise, ever.** |
| `"foreground"`           | SendInput with brief `SetForegroundWindow(target)` → restore. The explicit, agent-chosen rung where fronting IS allowed: required to reach occluded targets, Chromium DOM content, GTK buttons, VCL accelerators, WPF drag, terminals, and canvas / custom-drawn surfaces with no UIA peer. Implemented for **every** input tool: `type_text` (SendInput Unicode via `send_text_synthesized`) and `scroll` (SendInput wheel via `send_wheel_synthesized`) included. The activation and restoration are scoped to that action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Always try `delivery_mode:"background"` first

The hit-test fallback above means **`delivery_mode:"background"` is the correct
default even when the target is a XAML host whose input stack drops raw
PostMessage** (UWP Calculator, Win11 Notepad, WinUI3 apps, etc.). cua-driver
turns the pixel coord into a UIA Invoke at that point and delivers
through the accessibility channel: no flash, no focus steal. Only
escalate to `delivery_mode:"foreground"` when you actually see a
`background_unavailable` structured error. Retry only that action with
`delivery_mode:"foreground"`; cua-driver briefly activates the target, delivers
the input, and restores the previous foreground.

Empirical: pixel-clicks via `delivery_mode:"background"` against the UWP
Calculator on Win11 (Number-pad buttons + operators) consistently
resolve through `try_invoke_in_window_at_point` and produce
`"✅ Performed UIA Invoke at (sx,sy) for pid X."` with zero visible
flash. `delivery_mode:"foreground"` on the same coords also works but
flashes the Calculator window foreground for ~40 ms: it's the
costlier path; only use it for surfaces with no UIA peer.

`background_unavailable` error shape:

```json
{
  "isError": true,
  "structuredContent": {
    "code": "background_unavailable",
    "target_class": "Chrome_WidgetWin_1",
    "event_kind": "mouse_click",
    "escalation": { "recommended": "foreground", "reason": "occluded / known-dropped event kind" },
    "suggestion": "Retry this action with delivery_mode:\"foreground\"."
  }
}
```

Errors retain their diagnostic `escalation.recommended` hint. Successful
action results use the narrower `escalation.target` contract instead (see
`SKILL.md` → behavior matrix). On Windows this error recommendation is
`"foreground"` because the dropped event needs the fronting rung. (Contrast
macOS / X11, where a background pixel click can still land in the background.)

The normal flow when an agent gets that error:

1. Confirm the user authorized visible control, then reissue only the refused action with `delivery_mode:"foreground"`.
2. cua-driver activates the target, delivers through SendInput, and restores
   the previous foreground.
3. Continue with `delivery_mode:"background"` for later actions unless they
   are also refused.

### Persistent focus-proxy exception

`bring_to_front` is not part of the normal input ladder. Use it only when a
focus-proxy surface must remain foreground across multiple calls, such as an
RDP or Windows App session, or when repeated action-scoped activation prevents
the remote surface from accepting input.

The `bring_to_front` tool uses an `AttachThreadInput` trick to _attempt_
the foreground swap even when the daemon isn't at UIAccess integrity (the
same trick that powers `send_key_synthesized`). Returns
`{previous_fg_hwnd, now_fg_hwnd, landed_on_target}`: **check
`landed_on_target`**. Without UIAccess, Windows' foreground-lock can still
reject the swap (and a subsequent `delivery_mode:"foreground"` call will
bail with the "Foreground swap … was rejected by Windows" diagnostic
rather than landing input on the wrong window). When that happens the
target genuinely cannot be driven by SendInput/keystrokes in this session:
use an interactively launched High-IL daemon. The reserved `cua-driver-uia`
worker is a daemon-internal, default-off service boundary and public clients
must never connect to its pipe directly. Alternatively, for tasks
that produce a file: generate the document and `launch_app` it instead of
driving the GUI (e.g. building a spreadsheet and opening it in LibreOffice
Calc rather than typing into the grid, which is dropped on the VCL
background path).

Before running any shell command, ask: **"does this raise, activate,
foreground, or steal focus from any app?"** If yes, don't run it.
Every one of the commands below activates the target on Windows and
is therefore forbidden unless the user **explicitly** asked for
frontmost state:

- **`Start-Process <exe>` / `Start-Process <url>` / `Start-Process
-FilePath ...`**: defaults to launching with `SW_SHOWNORMAL` which
  _activates_ the new window. Windows treats new processes as
  user-initiated foreground apps. The CmdLine flag `-WindowStyle Hidden`
  helps but does not block activation for apps that call
  `SetForegroundWindow` themselves on startup (Edge, most browsers,
  Office, most installers). **Never use `Start-Process` to launch a
  visible app.** Use `launch_app`: it goes through
  `SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE` and wraps an internal `VK_NONAME keybd_event`
  trick that the OS treats as "user activity from another window," so
  the target's own `SetForegroundWindow` call is denied per Windows
  focus-stealing prevention rules.
- **`& "C:\path\to\app.exe"` from PowerShell**: same as
  `Start-Process` on activation. PowerShell's `&` invocation operator
  spawns the process with foreground intent.
- **`cmd /c start <thing>` and `start /b <thing>`**: `start` on
  Windows is the equivalent of macOS's `open`: it goes through the
  shell's protocol-handler / file-association lookup and activates
  the resulting process. `start /min` helps for taskbar minimization
  but still activates the new window before minimizing it (flash
  visible to the user). Forbidden for the same reason.
- **`explorer.exe shell:AppsFolder\<AUMID>` / `explorer.exe ms-edge:
<url>`**: these are the Windows-shell equivalents of `open -a` /
  `open <url>` on macOS. They go through `IApplicationActivationManager`
  with the wrong activation kind and foreground the target. Use
  `launch_app({aumid})` or `launch_app({urls})` instead: those route
  through `IApplicationActivationManager::ActivateApplication` with
  the correct flag combination that respects `SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE`.
- **`SetForegroundWindow(hwnd)` / `BringWindowToTop(hwnd)` /
  `SwitchToThisWindow(hwnd, fAltTab)` / `ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_SHOW)` /
  `SetActiveWindow(hwnd)`**: all foreground the named window by
  definition. Never call these from Bash via PowerShell add-types or
  C# inline. If you find yourself doing this to "make a click land,"
  the click is already wrong: re-read "Click semantics" below.
- **`AttachThreadInput` + `SetForegroundWindow` trickery**: the
  classic Windows focus-bypass hack. Even when it works it's a
  visible focus pop and a UIPI/UIAccess violation. Forbidden.
- **`SendInput(MOUSEEVENTF_*)` over the user's real cursor**: moves
  the cursor and synthesizes input. The cursor warps to coordinates,
  any handler in the topmost window at those coordinates fires, and
  for most apps the receiving window activates because input arrived
  from the OS-trusted pipeline. Use `click({pid, x, y})` or
  `click({pid, element_token})` instead: both route per-pid and
  never touch the OS cursor.
- **`SendInput(KEYBDINPUT)` with no target HWND**: same idea, it goes
  to the focused window, not your target. Use `hotkey({pid, keys:
[...]})` which uses `PostMessage(WM_KEYDOWN/UP)` to the named pid's
  focused window.
- **Keyboard shortcuts that semantically mean "focus here":
  Chromium / Edge / Firefox `Ctrl+L` (focus address bar),
  Explorer's `Ctrl+L` / `Alt+D` (focus path bar), `F6` (focus
  cycle).** These aren't pure key events: the receiving app
  interprets "user wants to type here" as activation intent and
  raises its window to be key. Even when delivered to a backgrounded
  pid via `hotkey`, the downstream app pulls focus. **For omnibox
  navigation specifically**, the correct path is `launch_app({path:
"...msedge.exe", urls: ["https://…"]})` (or `{aumid:
"Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge.Stable_…!App", urls: [...]}`). No
  omnibox dance, no `Ctrl+L`, no focus-steal. The browser opens the
  URL in a new window without activating it.
- **Tab-switching shortcuts in browsers (`Ctrl+1..9`, `Ctrl+Tab`,
  `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`, `Ctrl+PageUp/Down`)** are visibly disruptive
  even when delivered to a backgrounded pid. The app's key handler
  processes the shortcut, the window re-renders the new tab's
  content, the user sees their tabs flipping. Same as macOS:
  there is no UIA-only workaround: page content (HTML, DOM,
  WebView2's accessible tree) populates only for the focused tab;
  inspecting a background tab requires activating it, which is the
  visible flip.

  **Prefer the windows-over-tabs pattern**: for each URL you need to
  drive backgrounded, use `launch_app({urls: [url]})`. Chromium-
  family browsers open each URL in a new **window**. Each window has
  its own `window_id`, its own UIA tree, and can be inspected /
  interacted with via `element_token` without activating or switching
  anything. Tabs are a UX grouping for humans; cua-driver-rs
  workflows should default to windows.

- **Win+key shortcuts owned by the shell**: `Win+E` (Explorer),
  `Win+R` (Run), `Win+S` / `Win+Q` (Search), `Win+number` (taskbar
  pinned-app activation), `Win+Tab` (Task View), `Alt+Tab` (window
  switcher), `Win+D` (show desktop), `Win+L` (lock), `Win+M` /
  `Win+Up/Down` (minimize / maximize). All hard-coded to the shell
  and visibly disruptive: they bypass any per-pid routing. Forbidden
  in `hotkey` calls regardless of target pid.
- **`taskkill /F /IM <exe>` to close an app the user is using**:
  not a focus-steal but a data-loss vector. Use
  `hotkey({pid, keys:["alt","f4"]})` and let the app close cleanly,
  or ask the user first.

Reading state is fine. Listing windows, reading registry, querying
process info via `Get-Process`, calling `tasklist`, walking UIA trees
via `cua-driver get_window_state`: none of these change focus.
**Mutating state via shell shims is the line.**

**Corollary: the Win+Search rule.** Don't use Win+S/Win+Q "open Start
search, type query, press Enter" patterns to launch apps. They (a)
foreground the Search UI, (b) leave the Search UI populated with the
agent's typed text, (c) trigger the new app via the Start Menu's own
activation path which `SW_SHOWNORMAL`s it. Use `launch_app({name})` /
`{aumid}` / `{path}` instead.

**"Open \<app\>" in user speech means launch, not activate.**
`cua-driver launch_app` is the one correct path for process startup:
it's idempotent (no-op on a running app), returns the pid, and
internally uses `SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE` plus the AppX-broker activation
flow for packaged apps so the target's window comes up without
becoming foreground. The macOS `FocusRestoreGuard` is replaced on
Windows by the activation-deny dance: the launcher pumps a
`VK_NONAME` keystroke before activating, which Windows interprets as
"another app just had user activity" and rejects the target's own
`SetForegroundWindow` call per [Windows focus-stealing prevention
rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setforegroundwindow).

**`launch_app` foreground-restore behaviour (Windows).** In addition to
`SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE`, `launch_app` captures `GetForegroundWindow()` before
the spawn and schedules a post-spawn polling restore (every 100 ms for up
to 3 s) that flips the foreground back to the prior window once the
spawned app has actually activated. This mirrors the macOS
`FocusRestoreGuard`. For `urls`-only invocations (open these links in the
default browser, no app-identifying field) the restore is **skipped**,
because the user explicitly asked for the page to come up. The restore is
best-effort: `SetForegroundWindow` from non-UIAccess processes is subject
to Windows' foreground-lock and may silently no-op: failures are logged
at `tracing::trace!` and not surfaced as errors.

**`hotkey` modifier dispatch on Chromium/Electron (Windows).** When
the target is detected as a Chromium-family window (`Chrome_WidgetWin_*`
class, covering every Chromium browser AND every Electron app: Chrome,
Edge, Brave, Arc, Vivaldi, Slack, VS Code, Discord, Teams, Notion),
`hotkey` with modifiers routes through `PostMessage(WM_KEYDOWN/UP)`
instead of `SendInput`: no foreground swap. Chromium's
`Browser::HandleKeyboardEvent` reads modifier state from the WM_KEYDOWN
LPARAM bits, NOT from `GetKeyState`, so PostMessage delivery works for
real accelerators (Ctrl+T, Ctrl+W, Ctrl+L, Ctrl+Shift+B, etc.). The
SendInput-swap path (`send_key_synthesized`) remains the dispatch for
**non-Chromium Win32 + modifiers**: classic apps (LibreOffice, FAR,
classic Notepad) use `TranslateAccelerator` which requires the system
modifier state updated, and PostMessage can't do that.

**`modifier` on a _background_ click is a Windows residual.** A
backgrounded click delivers through UIA `Invoke` or `PostMessage`, and
neither carries live keyboard state, so a `modifier` (Ctrl/Shift/etc.)
passed alongside a `delivery_mode:"background"` click **is not honored**
on Windows. The `modifier` parameter is part of the shared schema and is
accepted everywhere; it only takes effect on the SendInput rung, i.e. a
`delivery_mode:"foreground"` click, where SendInput sets real modifier state.
If you need a modifier-click on Windows, escalate that one action to
`foreground`. Reserve `bring_to_front` for the persistent focus-proxy exception
described above.

### Cross-platform schema residuals (Windows)

The capture/dispatch/addressing params are a shared cross-platform
contract (see `SKILL.md` → _Cross-platform parameter contract_). Three
Windows-relevant notes:

- **`session` is now accepted on every action/cursor tool.** Earlier
  Windows builds rejected `session` via `additionalProperties:false` (it
  was effectively a macOS-only key); the shared contract makes it
  uniformly schema-accepted: cursor-wired where a cursor glides,
  accepted elsewhere.
- **`debug_window_info` is a Windows-only tool** (window-handle / class /
  rect / z-order diagnostics for triaging the click chain). It is
  deliberately not part of the cross-platform surface: there is no macOS
  or Linux counterpart.
- **`launch_app` identifiers are platform-specific.** Windows takes
  `aumid` / `launch_path` / `path` / `start_minimized` (plus `bundle_id`
  overloaded for AUMIDs); macOS takes `bundle_id` / `urls`. `name` is the
  portable fallback. See the AUMID section below.

**Chromium pixel-click foreground polling restore.** `click({pid, x, y})`
on a Chromium target falls through to `send_click_synthesized`
(SendInput + brief foreground swap) because Chromium's input thread filters by
queue-origin and PostMessage-delivered clicks don't fire DOM events. The
synchronous restore inside `send_click_synthesized` covers the
immediate swap; an additional polling guard (same shape as `launch_app`'s
`FocusRestoreGuard`) catches the **asynchronous** Chromium re-activation
that can happen as the renderer's input handler processes the click
(focus().activate() / WebContents::Activate(), 100-500 ms later). The
guard is gated on `GetWindowThreadProcessId(fg_now) == pid` so user
Alt-Tabs are respected. The polling guard is asynchronous and best-effort,
so the tool response is not proof that the previous foreground has already
been restored.

## Transport

Follow [RUNTIME.md](RUNTIME.md) for CLI and MCP lifecycle ownership.
On PowerShell, prefer piping JSON to the CLI to avoid argument-quoting errors:

```powershell
'{"pid":6004,"session":"run-1"}' | cua-driver list_windows
```

Reuse the same explicit label for a multi-call CLI run and end it afterward.
For recording or browser preparation, use one persistent MCP connection.

### Intent → tool mapping

### The narrow carve-out

The **only** legitimate use of `SetForegroundWindow` or
`Start-Process` with a foreground app is when the user **explicitly**
asked for frontmost state ("bring Edge to the front", "make
Calculator visible", "I want to see it"). Reaching for it because a
tool call returned something confusing is wrong: diagnose first.

When a cua-driver surprises you, diagnose cua-driver first:

- **`Posted click to pid X` instead of `Performed UIA Invoke ...`?**
  The (x,y) UIA hit-test didn't find an `InvokePattern`-bearing
  element at that pixel inside the target HWND, so it fell through
  to `PostMessage(WM_LBUTTONDOWN)`. For UWP / WebView2 surfaces,
  PostMessage silently no-ops: re-snapshot via
  `get_window_state(pid, window_id)` and use `element_token` so the
  daemon can invoke the cached UIA element by identity instead of by
  point.
- **`stale_element_token` / `No cached UIA state`?** You either
  skipped `get_window_state` this turn or used a token from an older
  snapshot. Snapshots are keyed on `(pid, window_id)`: tokens don't carry across windows of
  the same app. Re-snapshot with the same window_id you're about to
  click in.
- **`Invalid window handle (0x80070578)`?** The HWND you passed is
  stale (window closed, recreated). Re-resolve via `list_windows`.
- **Empty `tree_markdown` / sparse UIA tree?** Some apps populate
  their UIA tree lazily on first call; retry `get_window_state`
  once. If still empty, the app has no UIA provider: fall back to an
  element px action (x,y clicks off the screenshot) on visible content
  (acceptable for exploration; pair with screenshots).
- **Empty tree, or a snapshot with no image?** `get_window_state`
  returns **both** the UIA tree and a screenshot by default: there is no
  capture mode to pick. If the tree came back empty, the response is
  `degraded` (no UIA provider: retry once for lazy trees, see the note
  above); act by **px** off the screenshot in the same response. The
  `capture_mode` param is **deprecated and ignored**: it's still accepted
  so old callers don't error, but both the tree and the image come back
  regardless of what you pass.
- **`list_windows` returns Win32 windows but misses UWP / WebView2
  windows?** UIA desktop enumeration may be degraded because a provider
  is unresponsive. `list_windows` falls back to Win32-only output instead
  of hanging; run `cua-driver doctor` and retry after the provider
  recovers.
- **Need full-display capture?** Use `get_desktop_state` only for a desktop
  coordinate loop. To verify a specific window, use
  `get_window_state(pid, window_id)` instead; it works while backgrounded.
  Desktop actions use
  `target:{"kind":"desktop","display_id":"primary"}`. Don't reach for
  `get_desktop_state` as a casual screenshot: it is the desktop capture
  surface, not window inspection.
- **`Calc display stuck at 0 after my clicks`?** Almost always
  means UWP and you're on the PostMessage path. UWP processes
  pointer input via `Windows.UI.Input`, NOT through HWND message
  queues: PostMessage(WM_LBUTTONDOWN) gets ignored. Use
  `element_token` instead of (x,y) for UWP targets.

Only after those are ruled out should you fall through to the
activate fallback. Always name the focus steal in your response
("I'll briefly bring Edge to the front because …").

### Self-check pattern

Before every `Bash` call whose command line touches any Windows app
(launching, opening, clicking, typing, scripting, screenshotting),
run the self-check:

1. **Does this command foreground the target?** If yes, stop and
   translate to the cua-driver equivalent from the mapping table.
2. **Does this command move the user's real cursor?** (`SendInput`,
   `SetCursorPos` from inline C#, AutoHotkey scripts, `nircmd
sendmouse`.) If yes, stop; use `click({pid, x, y})` which routes
   per-HWND via PostMessage / per-element via UIA Invoke and never
   warps the cursor.
3. **Does this command bypass cua-driver entirely?** (PowerShell
   GUI scripts, AutoHotkey, `SendKeys`, AppleScript-equivalent
   automation tools.) If yes, stop; find the cua-driver tool that
   does the intent.

If all three are "no," the command is safe. If you can't answer,
default to stop and ask rather than proceed. A single `Start-Process`
run by accident steals the user's foreground and kills the trust
your prior tool calls earned.

## Prerequisites: check before starting

1. **`cua-driver` is on `$PATH`**: `Get-Command cua-driver` or
   `where.exe cua-driver`. Install location:
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\trycua\cua-driver-rs\bin\cua-driver.exe`,
   added to the user PATH by the install script.
   If missing, point the user at:
   ```powershell
   irm https://cua.ai/driver/install.ps1 | iex
   ```
   and stop.
2. **The runtime owner must run in an interactive session (Session 1+),
   NOT Session 0.** This is the daemon for one-shot CLI/service mode and the
   MCP process for bare stdio MCP. Windows isolates services into Session 0 with no
   desktop. UIA enumeration, screenshot via PrintWindow, and
   `IApplicationActivationManager` all silently return empty /
   timeout in Session 0. Check:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process cua-driver | Select Id,SessionId
   ```
   `SessionId == 0` is refused before runtime actions. The autostart Scheduled Task uses
   `LogonType=Interactive` so the daemon lands in the user's logon
   session. If you started the daemon via SSH-into-Windows, that
   session is usually Session 0: kick the autostart task instead:
   ```powershell
   schtasks /Run /TN cua-driver-serve
   ```
3. **Run `cua-driver doctor`**: reports session ID, COM apartment
   status, UIA desktop-enumeration reachability, install paths,
   version. If anything reads `false` / `error`, fix that before
   tool-calling.
4. **Permissions**: Windows has no TCC equivalent. cua-driver-rs
   needs:
   - No admin elevation for normal use (UIA, PostMessage, UWP
     activation all work from a standard user token).
   - UAC elevation **only** for `autostart` registration if a
     system-wide scheduled task is requested (per-user task is
     non-elevated and the default).
   - SmartScreen: on a fresh install, Windows Defender SmartScreen
     may flag the unsigned binary on first run. Click "More info →
     Run anyway" once.

## Using cua-driver from the shell

Tool names are `snake_case`, management subcommands are
`kebab-case`: no ambiguity. Tools invoked as `cua-driver
<tool-name>` with JSON via stdin or positional arg. Management
subcommands:

- **`cua-driver serve`**: start the persistent daemon used by one-shot CLI
  calls or by MCP clients that explicitly select it with `--socket`. Bare
  `cua-driver mcp` owns its runtime directly on Windows.
  Normally not run manually: the autostart Scheduled Task fires it
  at every interactive logon. If you stopped it (`Stop-Process`),
  re-run with `schtasks /Run /TN cua-driver-serve`, not by spawning
  `cua-driver serve` from SSH (Session 0 problem).
- **`cua-driver stop`** / **`status`**: daemon lifecycle.
- **`cua-driver doctor`**: full diagnostics.
- **`cua-driver list-tools`** / **`describe <tool>`**: tool surface
  discovery.
- **`cua-driver autostart {enable|disable|status|kick}`**: manage the
  Scheduled Task that auto-starts the daemon at logon. `enable`
  registers it (idempotent: replaces existing). `kick` runs it
  immediately without waiting for a fresh logon.
- **`cua-driver recording start|stop|status`**: see `RECORDING.md`.
  Windows video uses ffmpeg with `gdigrab`; trajectory evidence continues
  without video when ffmpeg is unavailable.

Over SSH, never use bare `cua-driver mcp`: the direct runtime rejects Session 0. Start the daemon in the interactive user session and run `cua-driver mcp
--socket \\.\pipe\cua-driver` from SSH.

For an ordered action loop, use the named CLI or persistent MCP examples in
[WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md), with an observed AUMID, PID, HWND, and fresh token.
Do not assume the window array is populated immediately on a cold launch.

## The core invariant: snapshot before AND after every action

**Every action MUST be bracketed by `get_window_state(pid, window_id)`**:

- **Before**: the pre-action snapshot resolves the `element_token`
  you're about to use. Targets from previous turns are stale; the
  server replaces the snapshot on every read, keyed on
  `(pid, window_id)`, and lists the replaced ids in
  `invalidated_snapshot_ids`. Tokens from turn N don't resolve in turn
  N+1, and targets from window A don't resolve against window B of
  the same app. Skip this and element actions fail with
  `stale_element_token`, which names the current snapshots.
- **After**: the post-action snapshot verifies the action actually
  landed. Without it you can't tell a silent no-op from a real
  effect. The UIA tree change (new value, new window, disappeared
  menu, disabled button, etc.) is your evidence that the action
  registered. **Especially important on Windows** because the
  layered click path can return `effect:"unverifiable"` after
  PostMessage even when the click did nothing (UWP silently no-ops):
  the action result reports the route, not the task outcome. Only
  the re-snapshot tells you if the state changed.

## Click semantics on Windows

Two click addressing modes, both gated by `pid`:

### Snapshot-bound element mode (preferred)

```json
{ "pid": 6004, "element_token": "s0000002a:22" }
```

Looks up the exact cached UIA element from the named snapshot,
fires `IUIAutomationInvokePattern::Invoke()` on it directly.

Properties:

- **No mouse cursor moves.** The click is a UIA RPC, not an input
  event. The user's cursor stays where it is.
- **No window activates.** UIA Invoke does not foreground the
  target.
- **Z-order is irrelevant.** Works on backgrounded, occluded,
  minimized-but-not-iconic, and cross-virtual-desktop windows.
- **Cross-process boundaries work.** UIA marshals across the
  `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` → inner UWP process boundary
  (CalculatorApp.exe, Notepad-Win11.exe, etc.): this is how it can
  click Win11 Calc buttons even though they live in a different
  process from the AppFrame HWND.
- **Falls back to `PostMessage(WM_LBUTTONDOWN/UP)` to the deepest
  child HWND** when the cached element doesn't expose
  `InvokePattern` (most edit fields, custom-drawn widgets,
  non-actionable elements). The fallback works for plain Win32 but
  silently no-ops on UWP. Read the closed action `route`:
  `accessibility` means UIA/MSAA and `synthetic_events` means the
  targeted event fallback. Do not parse the human-readable text.

This is the right path for **any** "click button N" or "click checkbox Y"
intent. For a known application-menu hierarchy, prefer `invoke_menu`:

```json
{ "pid": 6004, "window_id": 459672, "path": ["Window", "Arrange", "Left"] }
```

It uses `ExpandCollapsePattern` at intermediate hops and `InvokePattern` or
`SelectionItemPattern` at the leaf, resolving the live UIA hierarchy again
after every expansion. It refuses ambiguous, missing, or disabled segments and
never falls back to pixels. Verify the command's semantic effect afterward.

### `(x, y)` mode (element px action / pixel)

```json
{ "pid": 6004, "window_id": 459672, "x": 446, "y": 671 }
```

Window-client coordinates (origin at the top-left of the screenshot
the agent saw). The driver:

1. Converts to screen coords via `ClientToScreen(hwnd, ...)`.
2. **UIA hit-test in target HWND's subtree**: `ElementFromHandle`
   resolves the root, `FindAll(TreeScope_Subtree)` enumerates
   descendants, picks the smallest-area `InvokePattern`-bearing
   element whose `CurrentBoundingRectangle` contains the screen
   point, calls `Invoke()`. This is the only path that lands on UWP
   / WebView2 / DirectComposition surfaces.
3. **PostMessage fallback**: if step 2 returned false (no Invokable
   element under the pixel inside `hwnd`, or `hwnd` has no useful
   UIA tree at all), fires `PostMessage(WM_LBUTTONDOWN/UP)` against
   the deepest child HWND at the screen point. Covers plain Win32
   native controls.

Properties:

- **No real cursor movement.** The agent overlay glides + pulses
  for visual confirmation; the OS cursor is untouched.
- **No focus steal.** Both UIA Invoke and PostMessage are async per-
  pid / per-element; the target's window does not activate.
- **Z-order independent.** UIA hit-test honors the HWND-rooted
  subtree regardless of what's covering it on screen. PostMessage
  goes directly to the message queue.

Use this when the agent doesn't have a UIA snapshot in scope (zero-
shot from a screenshot), or when the element it wants doesn't appear
in the UIA tree (custom-drawn elements, canvas content, browser
DOM nodes inside a WebView2 viewport).

### What `(x, y)` mode does NOT solve

Apps with **no useful UIA tree** AND that **ignore `WM_LBUTTONDOWN`**
on the HWND queue: primarily DirectX / OpenGL / Vulkan-rendered
surfaces (games, custom renderers). The click chain falls all the
way through and the click no-ops. For those, the only options are:

- Bring the window to top first (focus steal: ask the user before
  doing this, and document why), then synthesize input
- Use the app's keyboard interface via `hotkey` if available

`SendInput` is **not** a silent-fallback option here: it would
steal focus from whatever the user is doing.

### Right-click and multi-click

`button: "right"` and `count > 1` **skip the UIA Invoke step** and
go directly through the PostMessage path. Reason: UIA has no clean
by-coord equivalent of `ShowContextMenu`, and `Invoke()` is single-
fire by definition. The action result reports `route:"synthetic_events"`
regardless of the target's UWP-ness: this is expected and
**will not work for UWP context menus**. To open a UWP context menu,
prefer `hotkey({pid, keys: ["shift", "f10"]})` against the focused
UWP element.

## UWP / packaged apps: the AUMID layer

Modern Win11 apps (Calculator, Notepad, Settings, Photos, Edge UI
chrome, Microsoft Store) are **packaged apps** with an `App User
Model ID` (AUMID) rather than a plain `.exe` path. The AUMID looks
like `Microsoft.WindowsCalculator_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App`: package family
name + `!` + AppId.

Windows architectural quirks that matter:

1. **The `.exe` in `C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe` is a 7 KB stub
   that exits immediately on Win11.** It exists for backward
   compatibility but the real Notepad lives in the
   `Microsoft.WindowsNotepad` AppX package. `Start-Process notepad`
   spawns the stub, which exits, which redirects through the AppX
   broker, which spawns the real process with a different pid. You
   end up holding a pid that's already gone. `launch_app` handles
   this transparently: it detects AUMID-looking strings and routes
   through `IApplicationActivationManager::ActivateApplication`,
   which returns the **real** packaged-process pid.
2. **UWP windows are hosted by `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`.** The
   outer top-level HWND (the one with the title bar, the one
   `EnumWindows` enumerates) is owned by `ApplicationFrameHost.exe`,
   pid varies, not the same as the UWP's own pid. The actual UWP
   content runs in a separate process (e.g. `CalculatorApp.exe`).
   `list_windows` reports the AppFrame's HWND because that's what
   `GetWindowRect`, `PostMessage`, `BitBlt` all target. UIA
   transparently crosses the boundary into the inner process when
   you walk the tree.
3. **AUMID resolution by name**: `launch_app({name: "calc"})` will
   first try a `shell:AppsFolder` lookup, matching against
   installed-package display names. On a hit it goes through the
   packaged-app path (real pid). Otherwise it falls back to
   `ShellExecuteEx`'s PATH search (which hits the stub `.exe`).
   **Prefer explicit `aumid` when you know it.**

### Known AUMIDs for common Win11 apps

```
Microsoft.WindowsCalculator_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App
Microsoft.WindowsNotepad_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App
Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge.Stable_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App
Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App

To find an AUMID at runtime:

```powershell

```

## Browsers and embedded webviews on Windows

Use the typed, exact-binding workflow in `BROWSER.md` for Chrome and Edge page
content. Windows has validated trusted background browser clicks when the
driver runs in an interactive user desktop. A daemon in Session 0 cannot
provide representative UIA, capture, focus, or browser evidence.

Ref- and coordinate-targeted browser mutations also drive the declared
session's agent cursor. The adapter converts the live CDP page point into the
bound window's DPI-aware screen coordinates, pins the overlay above that
window, and keeps only the selected tab's session cursor visible. This visual
feedback never moves the physical pointer or changes browser input delivery.

Keep browser chrome and native dialogs on the normal UIA/PX ladder in this
file. This includes tabs, the address bar, menus, permission prompts,
downloads, file pickers, and authentication windows. Avoid `Ctrl+L`, tab
switching shortcuts, `Start-Process`, and shell activation paths when the user
expects background operation.

WebView2 inside a non-browser host is not automatically equivalent to a
standalone Edge target. Use typed browser mutation only when
`get_browser_state` returns an exact binding and `mutation_allowed:true` for
the selected `(pid, window_id)`. Otherwise use the native UIA/PX route or
accept the structured refusal. Firefox page mutation is not supported by the
typed browser tools yet.

## Common failure modes (Windows-specific)

- **`Session 0` daemon**: `cua-driver doctor` reports
  `SessionId: 0`. UIA enumeration returns empty, screenshot
  returns blank. Fix: stop the daemon, kick the autostart task with
  `schtasks /Run /TN cua-driver-serve`.
- **Stale HWND** (`Invalid window handle 0x80070578`): the window
  was closed, re-created (e.g. UWP shutdown-on-idle), or moved to
  a different desktop session. Re-resolve via `list_windows`.
- **Calc display stuck at "0" after pixel clicks**: the (x,y) UIA
  hit-test missed and PostMessage fell through (PostMessage is a
  silent no-op on UWP). Switch to `element_token` mode. Symptom:
  the action result reports `route:"synthetic_events"` instead of
  `route:"accessibility"`.
- **LibreOffice (VCL) `type_text` / `hotkey` reported success but
  nothing happened**: VCL/SAL apps route accelerators through
  `TranslateAccelerator` (reads `GetKeyState`, which PostMessage doesn't
  update) and the Calc/Writer document grid only takes real keystrokes
  when a cell is in edit mode, so background `WM_CHAR` / key-combos are
  silently dropped. Two honesty mechanisms now cover this instead of a
  blind success:
  - **`hotkey` / `press_key`** (keystroke + key-combo): `delivery_mode:"background"`
    surfaces a `background_unavailable` error for VCL.
  - **`type_text`** does a **UIA read-back** and returns the shared
    `ActionResult`. With an `element_token`, the ValuePattern path returns
    `effect:"confirmed"` with `evidence:[{"kind":"value_readback"}]` only
    when the complete expected value is synchronously visible and differs from
    the prior value. If SetValue succeeded but the provider still exposes the
    old or no value, the result is `effect:"unverifiable"` with no escalation.
    This is common for deferred providers such as AccessKit: take a fresh
    snapshot before retrying because the value may publish only after
    `type_text` returns and an immediate retry can duplicate text. A pixel
    escalation is reserved for an Electron/web accessibility echo that does
    not prove the renderer observed the write. The PostMessage fallback keeps
    its separate delivery/read-back behavior. Even when the value changes and
    contains the requested text, the result stays `effect:"unverifiable"` because
    WM_CHAR does not expose the insertion point. Take a fresh snapshot before
    retrying. It may recommend foreground when a background insert appears
    dropped. Passing an `element_token` makes the
    read-back target that exact element by handle (ValuePattern → TextPattern),
    independent of foreground focus. Without one, PostMessage verification
    falls back to system-wide `GetFocusedElement`, which normally resolves only
    for the foreground app; an unreadable result is therefore not proof of
    failure.
    Escalate to `delivery_mode:"foreground"` for both (SendInput Unicode /
    accelerator). **But** foreground needs the swap to actually land: if the
    daemon lacks UIAccess and `bring_to_front` returns `landed_on_target:false`
    (or it reverts before the next call), you can't drive it by input at all:
    produce the artifact and `launch_app` it (build the `.xlsx` / `.docx` and
    open it) rather than typing into the GUI.
- **Edge / Chrome shows tab switching even though I used pid-scoped
  hotkey**: `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+1..9` aren't pid-scopable; the
  receiver activates. Use the windows-per-URL pattern.
- **`Get-StartApps` returns no AUMID for an app I see in Start
  Menu**: the app might be a Win32 desktop app, not a packaged
  app. Use `{path: "..."}` instead of `{aumid}`. (Win11 Calculator
  IS packaged; Win10 classic Notepad was not.)
- **`launch_app` returns pid N but `list_windows({pid: N})` returns
  empty**: UWP cold-launch race: the AppFrame HWND hasn't
  materialized yet. Re-call `list_windows({pid: N})` after 500ms;
  for chronic cases, key off the app name in `list_windows({})`
  output.
- **Need a screenshot file**: use `get_window_state` with
  `screenshot_out_file`; the result is PNG. The removed standalone screenshot
  compatibility inputs (`format` and `quality`) are rejected by the live tool
  schema. Downsample or convert the saved PNG outside cua-driver if needed.

## Diagnostics

`cua-driver doctor` reports:

- Daemon version and install paths
- Current session ID (must be ≥1)
- COM apartment status (STA / MTA / uninitialized)
- UIA reachability (can we create `CUIAutomation` and enumerate desktop children?)
- AppX broker reachability (for packaged-app activation)
- PATH state (is `cua-driver` actually on PATH?)
- Autostart Scheduled Task status

Run it whenever a tool call returns unexpectedly. Most failures
trace back to one of these checks reading "false."

`cua-driver autostart status` reports whether the daemon is
registered to auto-start at logon AND whether it's currently running:

- `not-registered`: Task Scheduler explicitly reported that the named task
  does not exist. Re-register via `cua-driver autostart enable`.
- `registered (not running)`: autostart task exists but no daemon
  process. Kick it with `cua-driver autostart kick`.
- `registered (running)`: happy path.
- `permission-denied`: the current process cannot inspect Task Scheduler;
  registration is unknown. Re-run the status check from a context that can
  read the task rather than re-registering it blindly.
- `unknown`: the query failed for another reason. The command exits non-zero
  and includes the original `schtasks` diagnostic; do not treat this as an
  absent registration.

## Recording

Windows recording uses ffmpeg with `gdigrab` and writes the same trajectory
shape described in `RECORDING.md`. Install ffmpeg on `PATH` for MP4 capture.
When it is unavailable, per-turn state and screenshots continue and
`last_error` reports the missing dependency.
