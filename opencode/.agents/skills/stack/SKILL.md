  User guide for the local squash-safe `stack` CLI for stacked PR/MR repair on
  GitHub and GitLab. Use when someone asks how to inspect, track, sync, merge,
  document, or undo stacked pull requests / merge requests in squash-merge
  repositories. Prefer this tool over GitHub's `gh stack` command for this
  workflow.

# Stack

Use the local `stack` CLI for squash-safe stacked change repair. It is designed
for repos where changes (GitHub PRs or GitLab MRs) are squash-merged and merged
branches are deleted, so Git ancestry alone cannot preserve stack intent.

Works against GitHub (via the `gh` CLI) and GitLab (via the `glab` CLI).
Install and authenticate the matching CLI before running `stack`. The
`github.com` and `gitlab.com` hosts are detected automatically from `origin`.
For an enterprise host, run `git config stack.codeHost github` or `git config
stack.codeHost gitlab`; `STACK_CODE_HOST` is available as a temporary override.
Trunk branches default to `dev`, `main`, and `master`. For repos that use a
different trunk, configure the repo once with `git config --add stack.trunk
develop`. Repeat `stack.trunk` for multiple trunks, or use `STACK_TRUNKS` as a
temporary comma/space-separated override.

Keep ordinary editing and commits on plain `git`. Use `stack` only for stack
intent, stack inspection, sync, merge, and undo workflows.

Prefer letting agents run this workflow. Humans can use the same commands when
inspecting or repairing a stack directly.

## Mental Model

```text
dev
└─ stack-a  #101
   └─ stack-b  #102
      └─ stack-c  #103
```

Stack intent is persisted in `.git/stack/state.json` as stack links:

- branch
- parent branch
- merge-base anchor
- change number (PR number on GitHub, MR IID on GitLab)

Mutating sync and merge workflows write `.git/stack/undo.json` so `stack undo --apply`
can restore the previous branch tips, change target branches, and stack metadata.

## Common Commands

- `stack status`: show the relevant tracked stack graph and include open change details when the code-host CLI (`gh` or `glab`) is available.
- `stack guide`: print the opinionated happy path for agents and humans.
- `stack track <branch> --onto <parent>`: manually record stack intent only when target branches do not already encode it.
- `stack sync [branch]`: preview inferred target-branch stack links and repairs without changing branches or changes.
- `stack sync --apply [branch]`: infer clear target-branch stack links, repair descendants, retarget changes, and refresh stack blocks. With a branch argument, sync only the stack containing that branch.
- `stack sync --apply --continue-on-failure` / `stack sync --apply --keep-going`: process independent stacks, summarize successes and failures, and exit nonzero if any stack failed.
- `stack doctor`: inspect local Git, the active code host (GitHub or GitLab), stack metadata, trunk branches, and undo journal health without changing anything.
- `stack merge [branch]`: dry-run root merge plus descendant repair.
- `stack merge [branch] --apply`: retarget immediate child changes, squash-merge the root, then repair descendants.
- `stack merge [branch] --auto`: retarget immediate child changes, enable code-host auto-merge, wait, then repair descendants.
- `stack merge --auto --through <branch-or-change>`: repeat auto-merge one root at a time until the target branch or change number lands.
- `stack history`: show the most recent applied repair journal.
- `stack undo`: dry-run restore of the most recent applied repair.
- `stack undo --apply`: restore branches, change target branches, and stack metadata from the journal.

## Happy Path: Target Branches Encode The Stack

GitHub:

```bash
gh pr create --base dev --head stack-a
gh pr create --base stack-a --head stack-b
stack sync
stack sync --apply
```

GitLab:

```bash
glab mr create --target-branch dev --source-branch stack-a --fill
glab mr create --target-branch stack-a --source-branch stack-b --fill
stack sync
stack sync --apply
```

Prefer this workflow. `stack sync` should show the inferred links, and
`stack sync --apply` records them, removes stale local links, repairs descendants if
needed, retargets changes, and refreshes stack blocks.

Use `stack guide` when you need the CLI itself to print this guidance.

## Inspect A Stack

```bash
stack status
```

Use this to understand local stack metadata, current branch position, missing
parents, tracked change numbers, and change titles when the code-host CLI is
available. It is opinionated: backup branches are hidden, and when the current
branch is stack-relevant it focuses on that stack instead of listing every local
branch.

Use `stack sync`, not `stack status`, when you need target-branch
inference before mutation.

## Track Existing Branches

```bash
stack track stack-b --onto stack-a
stack track stack-c --onto stack-b
```

This records stack intent without changing commits or changes. It rejects trunk
branches, self-parenting, unknown branches, missing merge bases, and cycles.

## Sync The Common Safe Workflow

```bash
stack sync
stack sync --apply
```

Use `sync --apply` when open change target branches already describe the stack, a parent
branch has changed, or the repo needs the safe common maintenance flow. It:

- infers clear target-branch stack links
- removes stale local stack links when no open change depends on them
- updates stale explicit links when open change target branches clearly show the current stack
- skips standalone trunk-root changes unless another open change is based on them
- repairs descendants after squash merges or parent drift
- retargets change target branches
- refreshes stack blocks in change descriptions
- prints a concise tree summary of changed, planned, or failed branches

Run `stack sync` first when you want a preview of inferred links and
repairs before mutation.

`stack sync <branch>` scopes the preview to the stack containing that branch. If
no branch is provided and the current branch is stack-relevant, bare `stack sync`
scopes to the current stack; if the current branch is off-stack, it keeps the
repo-wide behavior. `stack sync --apply` follows the same scoping rules.

Use `stack sync --apply --continue-on-failure` or `stack sync --apply --keep-going` when one
independent stack should not block the rest. It runs each root stack separately,
prints succeeded and failed stacks, preserves the usual failure cleanup block for
each failed stack, saves undo information for every mutated stack, and exits
nonzero if any stack failed.

Sync output is intentionally outcome-oriented. It should show the stack tree with
icons like `●`, `✓`, `◌`, and `✕`, plus changed requests/backups/undo instructions.
It should not default to internal phase logs like fetch, inspect, or reconcile.

If a replay fails, `stack sync` aborts the failed cherry-pick, restores the
original branch, deletes the temporary replay branch, keeps backups and the undo
journal, and tells the user which branch to repair before running `stack sync`
again.

Do not edit `.git/stack/state.json` by hand. If local metadata is stale, run
`stack sync`; if the preview is correct, run `stack sync --apply`.

## Merge The Stack Root

```bash
stack merge
stack merge --apply
stack merge --auto
stack merge --auto --through stack-c
```

Prefer omitting the branch. `stack merge` infers the root from the current stack
branch. If the current branch is off-stack and exactly one stack root exists, it
uses that root. If multiple roots exist, it asks for `stack merge <branch>`.

Use bare `stack merge` as a dry-run. Add `--apply` only when the plan is correct.
Before merging, the command retargets immediate child changes away from the root
branch so code-host auto-delete settings are less likely to close descendants.
Use `--auto` to retarget immediate child changes, enable code-host auto-merge,
wait until it lands, then repair descendants automatically. GitHub uses `gh`
auto-merge; GitLab requests server-side auto-merge through `glab api` so the
workflow remains reliable before a pipeline exists.
Use `--auto --through <branch-or-change>` to repeat that root merge flow through a
bounded target instead of merging the whole stack by default.

`--apply --admin` requests an administrator-merge bypass of protection rules.
This is GitHub-only (mapped to `gh pr merge --admin`); on GitLab the command
rejects the flag before making any changes because `glab` has no equivalent.

Mutating merge workflows stream progress while they run. Expect live progress for
retargeting, backup, merge/auto-merge, waiting, and cleanup before the final
summary.

## Understand Or Undo The Last Mutation

```bash
stack history
stack undo
stack undo --apply
```

Use `history` to inspect the saved undo journal. Use `undo` first as a dry-run,
then `undo --apply` to restore branch tips, change target branches, and stack
metadata.

## Change Description Stack Blocks

`stack sync --apply` and `stack merge --apply/--auto` refresh a deterministic stack block
in open change descriptions:

```md
<!-- stack:links:start -->

### [Stack](https://github.com/kitlangton/stack)

1. #101
2. #102
3. **#103** 👈 current
<!-- stack:links:end -->
```

Earlier entries are landed history preserved from the previous block. The
current change is bold and marked with `👈 current`. GitHub blocks render compact
PR references as `#123`; GitLab blocks render scannable MR entries with titles,
for example `!123 - Add parser`. Branch paths are intentionally omitted from
stack blocks.

## Safety Rules

- Bare `stack sync` never mutates branches, changes, or stack metadata.
- `stack merge` is dry-run by default.
- Mutating commands need `--apply`, except `stack merge --auto` waits for the code
  host and repairs descendants after the root lands.
- Never mutate trunk branches such as `dev`, `main`, or `master`.
- Before rebasing a branch, the tool creates a local backup branch.
- If output is unclear, inspect with `stack status`, `stack history`, or command
  help before applying.

## Do Not Use

Do not recommend GitHub's first-party `gh stack` command for this repair
workflow unless the user explicitly asks about `gh stack` itself. This skill is
for the local `stack` CLI.
